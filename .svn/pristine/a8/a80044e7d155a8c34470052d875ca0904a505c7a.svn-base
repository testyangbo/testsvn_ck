Since Git is not installed and no diff was provided, I can't generate a specific commit message. However, here's a general template for when you're ready to commit:

```
Add initial project setup

Set up basic project structure with core dependencies.
Includes configuration files and directory layout needed
for future development.
```

When you have Git installed and actual changes to commit, please provide the `git diff` output and I'll generate a more specific, meaningful commit message based on your actual changes.
